\chapter{Code Organization}

The code for this report is based off of Google's Verified Boot reference repository\cite{vboot-codebase} and the modifications can be accessed in a cloned and edited repository\cite{my-repo}.
Changes were to the Verified Boot repo were mostly restricted to the main Makefile and the unit test folder \code{tests/}.

In order to have the results reproducible, all work was done inside of Vagrant Virtual Machine running Fedora 23. 
To get a working environment, clone the repository, initialize the Vagrant box, and run the following command:
\begin{equation}
    \code{\$PATH/CBMC-Vboot/scripts/install-fedora.sh} 
\end{equation}
This script will install the 49 packages required to run all of the code. 
Next, restart the Vagrant box and run the initialization script with:
\begin{equation}
    \code{\$PATH/CBMC-Vboot/scripts/init-fedora.sh} 
\end{equation}
This script will compile the 6 packages that need specific configurations.

The installation process takes roughly an hour on my 2015 Macbook Pro and the resulting VM image requires 4 Gbs of Hard Drive space. 

The \code{scripts/} folder contains the configuration scripts.
The main scripts are for installation, but there are also scripts to manage the SW TPM library, and to build a Vboot Image with related Public/Private keys.

The \code{qemu/} folder contains all of the code to run Vboot within QEMU with the hardware setup described in Section~\ref{qemu_em}.
The \code{tpm-pcr.c} file tests the only the TPM PCR functionality.
The \code{tpm-badcmds.c} file stress tests the TPM behavior with bad commands.
The \code{vboot-full.c} goes through the full process of Chrome's Verified Boot.
The \code{README.md} file contains information on building the software and using GDB testing.

The \code{CBMC/} folder contains all of the code for running Formal Verification on Vboot.
The python files with the naming structure \code{run\_\{\$FILE\}.py} will build and run the CBMC command for \code{\$FILE}.
The C files with the naming structure \code{test\_\{\$FILE\}.c} contain the main code being tested by CBMC\@.
The \code{README.md} file contains information on repeating the tests outlined in this report.

\section{Complete Verification Results}
\begin{itemize}
 \item  TPM locking -- tests that it is not possible for VbSelectFirmware to return success if it is unable to lock the TPM
 \item  LoadFirmware -- tests that it is not possible for control to pass to an Image if it is not selected by LoadFirmware
 \item  Array accesses -- check for all possibilities of array bounds errors.
 \item  Google Assertions -- this test replaces Google's assertions with CBMC assertions and checks that none of them are violated under any inputs
 \item  Rollback test -- tests that under no input conditions will LoadFirmware choose an Image with a lower version number (see Property~\ref{eq:rollback}).
 \item  Rollback/rec  -- this test is supposed to find a counter-example. It tests for rollback conditions without realizing that rollback is allowed under recovery. 
 \item  Hash Failure -- tests that it is impossible to verify an image as correct if hashing the Image Body returns an error (see Property~\ref{eq:hash_cor}).
 \item  RSA Failure -- tests that is impossible to verify an image as correct if verifying either the Keyblock or Preamble returns an error (see Property~\ref{eq:sig_cor}).
 \item  Array accesses -- check for all possibilities of array bounds errors.
   \item Error Handling --  the TPM returns success only if the TPM command completes successfully
    \item SetupTPM -- the TPM is initialized successfully with well-defined states
    \item  RollbackFirmwareWrite -- the RollbackFirmwareWrite function sends the write value to the TPM unmodified and no TPM assertions are broken
    \item  RollbackFirmwareLock -- the RollbackFirmwareLock function will always lock the correct section and no TPM assertions are broken
    \item SetTPMBootModeState -- the SetTPMBootModeState function sends the PCR value to the TPM unmodified and no TPM assertions are broken
   \item Liveness -- Checks that TpmSendReceive will not enter a state where it polls on an unchanging TPM register
   \item Error Handling -- Checks that TpmSendReceive will only return success if the TPM has performed a Send and Receive action successfully
   \item Data Receive -- Checks that TpmSendReceive will not return if the TPM still has data to send 
\end{itemize}
