% \textit{Several universities are beginning to employ undergraduates to help meet the demand caused by climbing enrollment rates. However, these student hires are typically not integrated into existing HR systems, which results in self-organized, and often poorly designed management setups. In this paper, we introduce} \tigeruhr{}, \textit{an application for administrating undergraduate resources. Our system priorities user-friendliness, and aims to streamline the hiring and registration process by removing data redundancy and intelligently inferring information wherever possible. The app also provides powerful management and scouting tools for position administrators.}
